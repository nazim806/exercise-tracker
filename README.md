**CORS:** allows ajax requests to skip the same-origin policy and access resources from remote hosts. Cors package provides an 

express middleware that can enable cors with different origin, so that we can easily access something outside of our server from our server.

**Mongoose:** simplifies interactions with mongoDB through node.js.

**dotenv:** loads environmental variables from a dotenv file into process.env.
